# CS572_American_Checkers
CS572 2016 Fall Project
Checkers or draughts is a classic strategy board game. Several practical issues concerning application of AI algorithms for this game have been pointed out and discussed. Our goal is to implement an AI agent for playing this game and compare the performance of different evaluation functions. Specifically, we use alpha-beta search with improved move ordering. Moreover, we consider 25 features to create effective heuristic evaluation functions.
